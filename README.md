# Quick Push & Pop PQ

<h1> Description : </h1>

This Project is Priority Queue data structure with the ability to push elements into the queue and pop the highest priority element from the queue. The class is implemented using a doubly linked list and a custom comparator to determine element priority.

<h1> Usage </h1>
To use these implementations of Priority Queue, you will need to provide a comparator to determine the order of objects in your queue.
<b>**Please note </b> that there are two different implementations for the PQ with different time complexities for push and pop.
 
 <h1> Time Complexity </h1>
<b>Quick POP data structure:</b>
 QuickPop peforme Push in time Complexity of O(n) 
 QuickPush performe Pop in time Complexity of O(1)
  
<b>Quick Push data structure: </b>
QuickPop peforme Pop in time Complexity of O(n) 
QuickPush performe Push time Complexity of O(1)
